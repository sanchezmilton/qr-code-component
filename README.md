## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 semantic markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

This is more of an overview of basic HTML and CSS, but I'd like to go deeper into improving the order and style of my web apps. Later I will investigate more about tools for CSS and I plan to also try Svelte and SvelteKit in dynamic web apps.
