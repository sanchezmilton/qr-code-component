## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 semantic markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwindcss

### Continued development

This is more of an overview of basic HTML and CSS, but I'd like to go deeper into improving the order and style of my web apps. Later I will investigate more about tools for CSS.

**Update**: I remade the challenge using Tailwindcss and the process was quite fast compared to using only css. I will keep practicing and adapting to this framework!
